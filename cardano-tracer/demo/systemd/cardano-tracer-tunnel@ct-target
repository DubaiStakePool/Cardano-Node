# Default values for the systemd unit cardano-tracer-tunnel
# /etc/default/cardano-tracer-tunnel@ct-target
#
# This service is meant to be established on the machine
# running cardano-node, where the node has been
# configured to be an Initiator of the connection
# to cardano-tracer.
# 
# The 'ct-target' is a mnemonic for the remote host that:
# * runs cardano-tracer
# * provides the socket file you want establish the tunnel to
#
# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY.
# THE FINAL VALUES DEPEND ON YOUR SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION.



# SSH identity for the tunnel.
# Please note that for this example, 
# remote-user@ct-target-host is assumed to accept this identity,
# e.g. by having added its public key to the remote user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
PATH_TO_KEY=/home/local-user/.ssh/id_rsa

# user to SSH to on the ct-target host
REMOTE_USER=remote-user

# IP or hostname that resolves to the ct-target host 
REMOTE_HOST=ct-target-host

# remote socket file on ct-target, as per the config of cardano-tracer
REMOTE_SOCKET=/path/to/cardano-tracer/socket.sock

# local socket file, as per the config of cardano-node
LOCAL_SOCKET=/path/to/cardano-node/socket.sock

# If you run another cardano-node or process emitting traces on the same
# network, you may tunnel more than one socket to cardano-tracer on ct-target,
# as long as you adjust the systemd unit file accordingly.
# 
# LOCAL_SOCKET2=/path/to/another/trace-emitter/socket.sock

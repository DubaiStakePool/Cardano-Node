name: Post Release Upload
# This makes it easy to get download release binaries built using
# a github action for any tagged commit.
#
# This workflow builds and uploads the macOS, win64 and linux
# binary packages as github artifacts.
#
# These can be accessed by:
# * Going to https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/actions/workflows/release-upload.yaml
# * Selecting a run
# The Artifacts should be listed at the bottom.
#
# Even though the artifacts themselves are compressed (.tar.gz and .zip files),
# the action/uppload-artifact puts each in its own .zip.
#
# The artifacts are then downloaded and uploaded to as release assets

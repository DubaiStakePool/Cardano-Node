-- | This should /only/ happen if we messed up the mapping in 'toConsensusQuery'
-- and 'fromConsensusQueryResult' so they are inconsistent with each other.
--
-- If we do encounter this error it means that 'toConsensusQuery' maps a
-- API query constructor to a certain consensus query constructor but that
-- 'fromConsensusQueryResult' apparently expects a different pairing.
--
-- For example, imagine if 'toConsensusQuery would (incorrectly) map
-- 'QueryChainPoint' to 'Consensus.GetEpochNo' but 'fromConsensusQueryResult'
-- (correctly) expected to find 'Consensus.GetLedgerTip'. This mismatch would
-- trigger this error.
--
-- Such mismatches should be preventable with an appropriate property test.
